        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh">Riyadh</a> (/riːˈjɑːd/
        ree-YAHD;[5] Arabic: الرياض, romanized: ar-Riyāḍ, standard
        pronunciation: [ar.riˈjaːdˤ], Najdi pronunciation: [er.rɪˈjɑːðˤ];
        lit. 'the Meadows') is the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia.[6]
        It is also the capital of the Riyadh Province and the centre of the
        Riyadh Governorate. The current form of the metropolis emerged as an
        offshoot of the eponymous walled town following the dismantling of its
        defensive fortifications in the 1950s, after which the city underwent
        several phases of expansion and urbanization.

      <h2>My Favorite Sport</h2>
      <p>
        My favorite sport is
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"
          >football</a
        >
        .Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is
        a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who almost
        exclusively use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field
        called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than
        the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a
        rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally,
        the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match
        time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over
        200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.

        My favorite movie is Puss in Boots : The Last WishPuss in Boots: The
        Last Wish is a 2022 American animated adventure comedy film produced by
        DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Universal Pictures. The sequel
        to the spin-off film Puss in Boots (2011) and the sixth installment of
        the Shrek film series, the film was directed by Joel Crawford,
        co-directed by Januel Mercado (in his feature directorial debut), and
        written by Paul Fisher, Tommy Swerdlow, and Tom Wheeler. Based on the
        character introduced in Shrek 2 (2004) and inspired by the fairy tale of
        the same name, the voice cast includes Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek
        reprising their respective roles as the titular character and Kitty
        Softpaws, with new additions to the cast including Harvey Guillén,
        Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo, John Mulaney,
        and Wagner Moura. The story follows Puss in Boots, who teams up with
        Kitty Softpaws and Perrito to find the Last Wish of the fallen Wishing
        Star to restore eight of his nine lives. They race against other fairy
        tale characters seeking the same treasure, while a sinister wolf hunts
        Puss himself
